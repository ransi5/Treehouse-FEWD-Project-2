# Lessons learnt and queries

is it more efficient to nest items such as images and paragraph within a div element and use div as a flex ite? 

Although, I tried experimenting by nesting a head element in a div and managed to reproduce the layout as in mockup images, however I could not come to an answer to the above question at the moment. 

I learnt it is best to turn primary elements to flex boxes given changes that may take place in future. I made this mistake with the header element and for 1024px screen media query, I had to nest it within a div element and give it the class 'mistake'. It was an experiment as I nested the flex box within the main element.

I hope I am not punished for the above experiments.
